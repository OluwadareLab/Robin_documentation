Large Language Model (LLM)
==========================

We have included GPT model and Jupyter Notebook. Users can ask to generate different types of plots similar to the ChatGPT app that are not available by default in Robin. To enable the AI assistant, users need to provide an API key and select a model name specific to the provided API key and see the AI-generated results in the top right corner.

   * Users can generate plots with their own interests using their uploaded dataset, even if those plots are not provided by default in Robin.  
   * Users can edit the AI-generated code using the integrated Jupyter Notebook.  
   * To get your OpenAI API Key, please follow `the instructions at this link <https://www.maisieai.com/help/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key-for-chatgpt>`_
